This repository holds financial calculators I wrote mostly for my own personal needs.

* [Retirement Tax Planner](rtp/README.md)
* [NS&I Premium Bond calculator](nsandi_premium_bonds.py), as [MoneySavingExpert's](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/premium-bonds-calculator/) is broken, but an even better calculator can be found [here](https://premiumbondsprizes.com/).
